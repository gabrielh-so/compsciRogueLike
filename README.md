# A Level Computer Science Project

Hi! This is a repository that includes the source files from my A level computer science major project.
The final product should be a top-down RougeLike twinstick shooter game, with procedually generated levels with rooms full of enemiers.
The project is written in c#, and uses a cross-platform monogame framework.
This repository is just for reference purposes and to keep a backup of changes I've made while being able to undo changes.
This is my first properly reposited project, so please be gentle.
